                           Self Join
                         ============

Self join:-Joining a table to itself is called self join. Here joining
=========  conditional columns must belongs to same data type.

  Generally in all relational databases self joins are used in
following 2 senarios. These are

1)Compare one table one column any value with all other values
  in same column.

2)Compare 2 different column values(same datatype) in a same table

   Whenever we are using self join then we must create table aliasnames in from clause.
These aliasnames must be different names. These aliasnames internally behaves like
exact tables when query execution time.

*1*Write a query to display the employee names and their manager names
 * from emp table by using self join(V.V.I.M.P)

SQL> select e1.ename Employees ,e2.ename as Manager from emp e1 ,emp e2 where e1.empno  = e2.mgr;

EMPLOYEES  MANAGER

13 rows selected.





2.Write a query to display the employees who are reporting to BLAKE as a manager
  from emp table by using self join?

3.Write a query to display the employees who are getting more salary than their
  manager salary from emp table using self join?

SQL> select e1.ename as Employees , e1.sal as Emp_sal,e2.ename as Manager, e2.sal as manager_sal from emp e1 ,emp e2 where e1.empno=e2.mgr and e1.sal<e2.sal;

4.Write a query to display BLAKE'S manager name from emp table 
  by using self join?

SQL> select e1.ename as Employees,e2.ename as Manager from emp e1 ,emp e2 where e1.empno=e2.mgr AND e2.ename='BLAKE';

EMPLOYEES  MANAGER
---------- ----------
KING       BLAKE




5.Write a query to display the employees who are joining
         before their managers from emp table
                by using self join?

SQL> select e1.ename as Employees,e1.HIREDATE AS JOINIG,e2.ename as Manager  ,e2.HIREDATE AS JOINIG_DATE_OF_MANAGER from emp e1 ,emp e2 where e1.MGR=e2.EMPNO AND  E1.HIREDATE<E2.HIREDATE;

6. Write a query to display the employees who are getting same salary
    as SCOTT salary f rom emp table using self join?
SQL> select e1.ename as Employees, e1.sal as emp_Sal,e2.ename as managers ,e2.sal as salary from emp e1,emp e2 where e1.sal=e2.sal and e1.Ename='SCOTT';

EMPLOYEES     EMP_SAL MANAGERS       SALARY
---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
SCOTT            3000 SCOTT            3000
SCOTT            3000 FORD             3000


NOTE:-when we are comparing one column any value with all other values in same column
===== by using self join then we must display data from second alias table only.



7.Describe in these two tables what is o/p of inner join, left outer
   join ,right outer join, full outer join

NOTE:- Guess the output with out executing queries in all cases

SQL>select * from q1;
